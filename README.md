# Product Review Analysis using Deep Learning Approaches  
ðŸ“Œ Bachelor Thesis â€“ International Islamic University Chittagong (2020) 

---

## 1. Project summary
This thesis implements automatic sentiment (product review) classification for *Bangla*-translated Amazon reviews using deep-learning approaches (CNN, Bi-LSTM, and CNN+LSTM). The goal is to build a Bangla review dataset, preprocess it, and compare model performance (accuracy, precision/recall/F1, AUC). Key findings: Bi-LSTM gave the best accuracy (~92.13%).

---

## 2. Dataset
- *Source:* Amazon product reviews (collected from multiple sources such as Kaggle, GitHub and web links), then translated into Bangla and manually labeled.  
- *Size:* *15,000* reviews (balanced: 7,500 positive, 7,500 negative).  
- *Categories included (examples):* Power banks, phones (mobile, iPhone), headphones, Kindle, books, kitchen & housewares, beauty & personal care, outdoor living, gourmet food, etc.

---

## 3. Preprocessing (as implemented)
- Tokenization (sentence/word) using Keras/NLTK approaches.  
- Punctuation removal, digit removal.  
- Stopword removal (Bangla stopword list â€” authors used a list of ~335 Bangla stop words).  
- Text â†’ integer sequences, padding to fixed length, embedding lookup (trainable embeddings).

## 4. Models & training details
*Models implemented*
- *CNN* (multiple 1D conv layers + MaxPool1D â†’ Flatten â†’ Dense).  
- *Bi-LSTM* (spatial dropout + bidirectional LSTM layers â†’ Dense).  
- *CNN with LSTM* (convolutional feature extraction followed by LSTM).  

*Training setup*
- Train/test split used: *70% train / 30% test* (10,500 train / 4,500 test).  
- Also evaluated using *5-fold cross-validation*.  
- Optimizer: *Adam; loss: **binary cross-entropy; output activation: **sigmoid*. Typical runs used ~20 epochs and batch size 32.

## 5. Results (key numbers)
- *CNN accuracy:* *91.49%* (test). AUC â‰ˆ 0.91.  
- *CNN + LSTM accuracy:* *91.01%*. AUC â‰ˆ 0.91.  
- *Bidirectional LSTM accuracy:* *92.13%* (best). AUC â‰ˆ 0.92.

## 6. Tools & environment
- *Platform:* Google Colab (used for experiments).  
- *Libraries:* Python, Keras / TensorFlow, NLTK (tokenization, stopwords), scikit-learn (metrics, preprocessing), matplotlib / seaborn (plots).
